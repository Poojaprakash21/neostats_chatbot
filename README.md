# neostats_chatbot
This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot built with Streamlit and LangChain. It acts as an intelligent assistant that provides contextual and factual answers by retrieving information from a provided knowledge base. The chatbot can also use a web search API as a fallback for general questions.
